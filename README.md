<!-- ## My Projects

Here are a few things I’ve worked on so far:

### 1. **ForensicInstaller**
This is a simple **Bash script** I made to automate installing forensic tools on **Kali Linux**. It's all about making the process quicker and easier for people diving into digital forensics.

- **Tech Used**: Bash, Kali Linux

### 2. **Music Downloader (Web Scraping)**
A Python tool I created using **Selenium** to scrape and download music from **YouTube Music**. Just give it a song name, and it’ll find it for you.

- **Tech Used**: Python, Selenium
